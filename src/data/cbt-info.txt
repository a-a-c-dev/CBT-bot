Distortion: All-or-Nothing Thinking (also called Black-and-White, Polarized, or Dichotomous Thinking)
Definition: Viewing a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum.
Examples:
If I'm not a total success, I'm a failure.
There was one typo in my report, so the whole thing is garbage.
I missed one day at the gym, so my entire fitness plan is ruined.
If my friend is angry with me, our friendship is over.
What We Can Do:
Challenge the absolutes. Is the situation really 100% a failure, or is it somewhere in between?
Use a scale. On a scale from 0 to 100, where does this situation realistically fall?
Find the middle ground. Can we identify a more balanced, less extreme way to describe this?
List both the positives and negatives to create a more complete picture.



Distortion: Catastrophizing (also called Fortune Telling)
Definition: Predicting the future negatively without considering other, more likely outcomes.
Examples:
I'm going to fail this exam and then I'll be kicked out of college.
If I miss this train, my whole trip will be ruined and I'll be miserable.
My heart is beating fast; I must be having a heart attack.
If I don't get this promotion, it means I'm a failure and will never get the job I want.
What We Can Do:
Examine the evidence. What facts support this prediction? What facts argue against it?
Consider other possibilities. What is the best-case scenario? What is the most realistic scenario?
"Decatastrophize." Even if the worst-case scenario happened, how would you cope? What would you do next?
Calculate the odds. What is the actual probability of this disaster occurring?



Distortion: Disqualifying or Discounting the Positive
Definition: Unreasonably telling yourself that positive experiences, deeds, or qualities do not count.
Examples:
I did well on that project, but that doesn't matter because anyone could have done it.
My friend said she likes my outfit, but she's just being nice and doesn't really mean it.
The team succeeded, but my contribution wasn't important.
I got a good grade, but it was just luck; it doesn't reflect my ability.
What We Can Do:
Own the positive. Make a rule to accept compliments with a simple "thank you."
Acknowledge your role. What specific actions did you take to contribute to this positive outcome?
Keep a positive evidence log. Write down positive events and your role in them, without discounting them.
Ask, "What would happen if I let myself believe this positive thing was true?"



Distortion: Emotional Reasoning
Definition: Thinking something must be true because you "feel" it so strongly, ignoring or discounting evidence to the contrary.
Examples:
I feel anxious, so I must be in real danger.
I feel guilty, so I must have done something wrong.
I feel overwhelmed and hopeless, therefore my problems are impossible to solve.
I feel unattractive, so I must be ugly.
What We Can Do:
Separate feelings from facts. Acknowledge the feeling, then ask, "What is the objective evidence, separate from my feelings?"
Identify the automatic thought that is causing the feeling.
Test the feeling. If you feel unproductive, try doing one small task and see if the feeling changes.
Remember that feelings are signals, not infallible truths.



Distortion: Labeling
Definition: Putting a fixed, global label on yourself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less disastrous conclusion.
Examples:
I'm a loser.
He's a horrible person.
I forgot to pay a bill, so I'm completely irresponsible.
She didn't agree with my point, so she must be ignorant.
What We Can Do:
Challenge the label. Is it possible for a "loser" to also do successful things?
Focus on specific behaviors, not global traits. Instead of "I'm irresponsible," say "I made a mistake by forgetting to pay that bill."
Look for evidence that contradicts the label. List times you have acted in a way that is inconsistent with the label.
Recognize that people are too complex for simple, one-word labels.



Distortion: Magnification/Minimization
Definition: When you evaluate yourself, another person, or a situation, you unreasonably magnify the negative and/or minimize the positive.
Examples:
Getting a C on a test is proof of how stupid I am (Magnification).
Getting an A is just a sign that the test was easy (Minimization).
I was five minutes late for the meeting; my reputation for being punctual is destroyed (Magnification).
Her promotion shows how successful she is (Magnification), while my own accomplishments are just minor things (Minimization).
What We Can Do:
Put it in perspective. What is the real, objective impact of this event?
Re-balance the scales. For every negative you magnify, identify a positive you have minimized.
Ask, "Am I looking at this through a 'reverse microscope'?"
Talk to a trusted friend to get an outside, more realistic perspective.



Distortion: Mental Filter (also called Selective Abstraction)
Definition: Paying undue attention to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole picture.
Examples:
I received many positive comments on my presentation, but I can only focus on the single critical remark.
My partner and I had a wonderful evening, but it was ruined because they made one comment I didn't like.
My boss praised my work on three major projects but pointed out one area for improvement, so I must be doing a terrible job.
Everything went well on my trip except for one rainy day, which made the whole vacation bad.
What We Can Do:
Widen your focus. Deliberately look for and write down the positive aspects of the situation you are ignoring.
Conduct a cost-benefit analysis. What are the pros and cons of focusing only on this one negative detail?
See the big picture. How important will this one detail be in a week? A month? A year?
Try to summarize the situation again, but this time you are not allowed to mention the negative detail.



Distortion: Mind Reading
Definition: Believing you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely possibilities.
Examples:
He's thinking that I don't know what I'm talking about.
She didn't wave back, so she must be angry with me.
They used a period at the end of the text; they must be annoyed with me.
The manager didn't ask for my opinion, so they must not value my contribution.
What We Can Do:
Check the facts. What is the actual, observable evidence for your belief?
Brainstorm alternative explanations. What are at least two other reasons for the person's behavior?
Recognize you cannot read minds. The only way to know for sure what someone is thinking is to ask them.
Ask yourself: "Even if they were thinking that, what would it mean? How would I handle it?"



Distortion: Overgeneralization
Definition: Making a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation.
Examples:
Because I felt uncomfortable at the party, I don't have what it takes to make friends.
I was rejected by one potential employer, so no one will ever hire me.
I went on one bad date, so I'll be single forever.
I tried to play the guitar and it sounded bad, so I'm not musically talented at all.
What We Can Do:
Look for counter-evidence. Have there been times when the opposite of this generalization was true?
Avoid absolute words like "always," "never," "everyone," and "no one."
Examine the evidence. Does this one instance truly predict all future outcomes?
Be specific. Instead of "I'm bad at everything," focus on the specific situation: "I found that one task difficult."



Distortion: Personalization
Definition: Believing others are behaving negatively because of you, without considering more plausible explanations for their behavior.
Examples:
My boss was short with me because I did something wrong.
The teacher was in a bad mood; it must have been because of the question I asked.
The party was boring because I wasn't being entertaining enough.
My child got a bad grade; it must be because I am a bad parent.
What We Can Do:
Identify other contributing factors. What are all the other things, outside of you, that could have led to this outcome?
Re-attribute responsibility. On a pie chart, assign percentages of responsibility to all the different factors involved.
Challenge the assumption. What evidence do you have that this is 100% about you?
Consider that most of the time, other people's behavior is about them, not you.

Distortion: "Should" and "Must" Statements (also called Imperatives)
Definition: Having a precise, fixed idea of how you or others should behave and overestimating how bad it is that these expectations are not met.
Examples:
I should always be at my best.
I must get everything on my to-do list done today or I've failed.
People should always be kind and fair.
He should have known that his comment would upset me.
What We Can Do:
Challenge the rule. Is this "should" statement realistic? Is it always true?
Analyze the consequences. What are the pros and cons of holding onto this belief? How does it make you feel?
Replace "should" with a preference. Try changing "I should..." to "I would prefer to..." and see how it changes your feeling.
Practice self-compassion. It's okay to be human and not live up to rigid expectations.



Distortion: Tunnel Vision
Definition: Zooming in on one negative aspect of a situation, ignoring all the positive parts.
Examples:
My son’s teacher can’t do anything right; he’s a terrible teacher.
We had a great family vacation, but I can only think about the one argument we had.
The entire project was a success, but I'm fixated on the one small feature that has a bug.
My partner is wonderful in so many ways, but I can only see the one annoying habit they have.
What We Can Do:
Widen the lens. Force yourself to list all the positive aspects of the person or situation you are ignoring.
Do a "full picture" summary. Write a new description of the situation that includes both the good and the bad.
Ask, "What am I missing?" Is there another way to look at this that is more complete?
Take a break. Step away from the situation to break the intense focus on the negative detail.
